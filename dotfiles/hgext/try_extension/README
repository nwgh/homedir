This extension lets you do something like

hg try -b do -p all -u all -t none

It will create an mq for you with the appropriate commit message, and push to
try, then get rid of the (empty) mq entry. It's also a bit more flexible with
the cli syntax, so you can do something like:

hg try -b d -p linux -p linux64

or:

hg try -b do -p linux,linux64 -u reftest -u mochitests

And it will Do The Right Thing (if it doesn't, it's a bug). You can even mix
and match within types:

hg try -b do -p win32 -p linux,linux64

It accepts all the usually-known try options (see hg help try with this
extension available for the full list of options - choices for those options
are left as an exercise to the reader).

You can also do:

hg try -m

And this will give you a mozilla-central-like try run.

If you have a set of try choices that you like to run with most of the time, you
can set those in your hgrc using REAL try syntax (the parser isn't as flexible
for this part, I should fix that at some point):

[try]
defaults = -b do -p all -u all -t none -n

It will use any of those as the defaults for that option, so if you don't supply
(for example) -t on the command line, you will get a run with no talos tests,
no matter what, but if you supply (for example) -p linux on the command line,
your final try string will look like:

try: -b do -p linux -u all -t none -n

If you only want one thing set as a default (for example, I like no emails
unless I explicitly request them), you can do:

[try]
defaults = -n

and the rest will be taken from your command line no matter what (-b and -p are
always required, FYI, otherwise it doesn't make much sense!)
